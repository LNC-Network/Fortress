Here’s a **comprehensive README** template for your Vault alternative project. It covers setup, architecture, commands, security notes, and contribution guidelines. You can expand or adjust as your project evolves.

# VaultX – A Self-Built Secrets Manager

**VaultX** is an alternative to HashiCorp Vault, designed for securely storing and managing secrets for teams and applications.  
It provides:

- Encrypted secret storage
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- CLI and API access
- Optional web dashboard
- Extensible architecture for plugins and dynamic secrets

## Features

- **Secret Storage** – AES-256-GCM encrypted secrets stored in PostgreSQL or KV store.
- **Authentication** – JWT, API tokens, or OAuth integration.
- **Role-Based Access Control** – Define who can read/write which secrets.
- **CLI Access** – `vaultx login`, `vaultx get secret`, etc.
- **Web Dashboard** – React/Next.js interface for managing secrets.
- **Auditing & Versioning** – Track secret access and history.
- **Extensible Architecture** – Add plugins for dynamic secrets (DB creds, cloud API keys).

## Tech Stack

| Layer       | Technology |
|------------|------------|
| Backend    | Go (Fiber / Echo) |
| CLI        | Go (Cobra) |
| Frontend   | Next.js + React + TailwindCSS |
| Database   | PostgreSQL |
| Encryption | AES-256-GCM, Ed25519 / RSA signing |
| Monorepo   | Nx |
| DevOps     | Docker, Docker Compose, Makefile |

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go >= 1.20
- Node.js >= 20
- pnpm / npm
- Docker & Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL (local or container)

### Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vaultx.git
cd vaultx


---

## Running the Apps

### 1. Backend API (Go)

```bash
nx run backend:serve
# or
cd apps/backend
go run cmd/main.go
```

### 2. CLI

```bash
nx run cli:run
# or
cd apps/cli
go run cmd/main.go
```

### 3. Web Dashboard (Next.js)

```bash
nx serve web
# or
cd apps/web
pnpm dev
```

### 4. Full Stack via Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up
```

---

## Database Setup

```sql
-- Example: PostgreSQL
CREATE DATABASE vaultx;
CREATE USER vaultx_user WITH PASSWORD 'vaultx_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE vaultx TO vaultx_user;
```

- Apply migrations (if any) with your migration tool (Drizzle, Flyway, etc.)

---

## Encryption & Security

- Secrets are encrypted **AES-256-GCM** at rest.
- Master keys are never committed; manage via environment variables or KMS.
- All API communications are via **HTTPS**.
- CLI communicates with backend via **secure REST/gRPC**.

**Env variables example** (`.env`):

```
VAULTX_MASTER_KEY=your_master_key_here
DATABASE_URL=postgres://vaultx_user:vaultx_password@localhost:5432/vaultx
```

---

## Development Workflow

- Use Nx to run, build, and test apps:

```bash
nx serve backend
nx serve cli
nx serve web
```

- Use Makefile shortcuts:

```bash
make run-backend
make run-web
make run-cli
make build-all
```

- Shared code lives in `/libs/shared` and can be imported by any app.

---

## Testing

- Backend: Go tests

```bash
cd apps/backend
go test ./...
```

- CLI: Go tests

```bash
cd apps/cli
go test ./...
```

- Frontend: React testing library / Jest

```bash
cd apps/web
pnpm test
```

## Contributing

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch: `feature/your-feature`
3. Run tests locally
4. Submit a pull request
5. Follow Nx workspace conventions

---

## Roadmap

- [ ] Secret versioning
- [ ] Secret TTL / lease system
- [ ] Plugin system for dynamic secrets
- [ ] Multi-user roles & teams
- [ ] Audit logs and analytics
- [ ] Remote cache / distributed backend

## Notes

- Designed as a **developer-friendly, self-hosted secrets manager**.
- Suitable for teams, personal projects, and experimentation.
- Security-focused: **audit and encryption are core principles**.

```

I can also create a **more visual version with architecture diagrams, Nx workflow, CLI commands cheat sheet, and environment setup tables** if you want — it would make this README **production-ready** for GitHub.

Do you want me to do that next?
